<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Effective Date: January 1, 2025</p>

<p>Welcome to the TikTok Posting Assistant (“the Service”). By accessing or using this Service, you agree to the following Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service.</p>

<h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
<p>The Service provides automated tools to upload and publish short-form video content to TikTok on behalf of authorized TikTok account owners. This includes generating captions, preparing media, and using TikTok’s Content Posting API.</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be the owner of the TikTok account or have explicit permission from the account owner to authorize the Service.</p>

<h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>You agree to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Service only for lawful purposes.</li>
<li>Authorize the Service through TikTok’s official OAuth process.</li>
<li>Ensure content you upload complies with TikTok’s Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Content Ownership</h2>
<p>You retain full ownership of all videos, captions, and other content submitted through the Service. We do not claim any rights to your media.</p>

<h2>5. API Integration</h2>
<p>The Service uses TikTok’s official developer APIs. All posting actions require explicit authorization using your TikTok credentials through a secure OAuth process.</p>

<h2>6. Data Usage</h2>
<p>The Service stores only the minimum required data (e.g., access tokens) to perform automated publishing. Sensitive data is not shared, sold, or distributed.</p>

<h2>7. Service Limitations</h2>
<p>We are not responsible for platform outages, TikTok API limitations, or failures caused by third-party services.</p>

<h2>8. Termination</h2>
<p>You may revoke access at any time through TikTok’s “Manage App Permissions.” Revoking access immediately disables posting automation.</p>

<h2>9. Modifications</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions about these Terms, please contact us at: support@yourdomain.com</p>
